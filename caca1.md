# Slide 2: Introduction
## Overview
Pipelining is a fundamental concept in modern computer architecture used to enhance instruction execution efficiency. This presentation explores different types of pipelines, their advantages, and nonlinear pipeline execution in depth.

# Slide 3: Non-Pipelined Execution
## Concept
- In a **non-pipelined processor**, instructions execute sequentially.
- Each instruction must complete before the next begins.
- This results in **longer execution time** and **lower CPU utilization**.

## Issues with Non-Pipelined Execution
- **Inefficient resource usage**: The CPU remains idle between instruction phases.
- **Slower throughput**: Each instruction takes the full cycle to execute.
- **Higher execution time**: Does not exploit instruction-level parallelism.

# Slide 4: Why Use Pipelining?
## Need for Pipelining
- Increases **instruction throughput** by executing multiple instructions in parallel.
- Breaks down execution into stages: **Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write-back**.

## Advantages of Pipelining
- **Higher throughput**: Multiple instructions execute simultaneously.
- **Improved CPU efficiency**: Reduces idle time of functional units.
- **Better performance**: Used in modern processors for optimized execution.

# Slide 5: Types of Pipelines
## Linear vs. Nonlinear Pipelines
### 1. Linear Pipelines
- Every instruction follows the same path through **fixed stages**.
- Common in **RISC architectures**.
- Example: **Classic 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB)**.

### 2. Nonlinear Pipelines
- Stages may **branch** or **merge**, allowing dynamic execution paths.
- Used in **superscalar, VLIW, and out-of-order execution processors**.

# Slide 6: Introduction to Nonlinear Pipelines
## Definition
- A **nonlinear pipeline** allows **dynamic execution paths** instead of a fixed sequence.
- Commonly seen in **superscalar** and **out-of-order execution** architectures.

## Characteristics
- **Dynamic Instruction Scheduling**: Instructions may execute in a different order.
- **Multiple Execution Units**: Can handle **data dependencies** more efficiently.
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Reduces pipeline stalls.

# Slide 7: Key Features of Nonlinear Pipelines
### 1. Out-of-Order Execution
- Later instructions may execute **before earlier ones**, improving efficiency.
- Example: **Tomasuloâ€™s Algorithm** in modern CPUs.

### 2. Branch Prediction
- Helps mitigate control hazards by **predicting the outcome of branches**.
- Used in **modern processors like Intel and AMD architectures**.

### 3. Superscalar Execution
- Multiple instruction pipelines run **simultaneously**, improving throughput.

# Slide 8: Challenges in Nonlinear Pipelines
### 1. Dependency Handling
- **Data dependencies** (RAW, WAR, WAW) require **hazard detection mechanisms**.
- **Solution**: Register renaming, forwarding.

### 2. Increased Complexity
- Needs **sophisticated control units** to manage execution order.

### 3. Pipeline Stalls & Mispredictions
- Branch mispredictions cause **pipeline flushing**, reducing efficiency.

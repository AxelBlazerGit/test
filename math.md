**Slide 1: Introduction to the Pigeonhole Principle**  
**Text:**  
- The Pigeonhole Principle asserts that if a greater number of objects (referred to as "pigeons") are distributed into fewer containers (called "pigeonholes") than the number of objects, at least one container must hold more than one object.  
- This principle was formally introduced by mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet in 1834 and is often termed the **Dirichlet’s Box Principle**.  
- It serves as a foundational concept in combinatorics, with extensive applications in mathematics, computer science, and practical problem-solving scenarios.

**Slide 2: Core Concept of the Pigeonhole Principle**  
**Text:**  
- **Basic Example:** If **6 socks** are placed into **5 drawers**, at least one drawer must contain more than one sock.  
- **Mathematical Representation:** Given **n** items distributed into **m** containers, where **n > m**, at least one container will contain at least ⌈n/m⌉ items.  
- This principle can be extended to more complex scenarios, accommodating various constraints and applications.

- A practical example, such as socks in drawers or students seated in a limited number of chairs.

**Slide 3: Applications in Mathematics and Computer Science**  
**Text:**  
- **Graph Theory:** The principle ensures the existence of repeated paths in directed graphs.  
- **Number Theory:** It is used to prove the existence of integer solutions in modular arithmetic problems.  
- **Computer Science:** The principle underpins algorithms in hashing, data compression, and error detection.  
- **Real-World Examples:**  
  - In a group of **367 people**, at least two individuals share the same birthday (Birthday Paradox).  
  - In social networks, certain users must have the same number of connections.

**Slide 4: Advanced Versions of the Pigeonhole Principle**  
**Text:**  
- **Strong Formulation:** If **n** objects are placed into **m** containers, at least one container must contain at least **⌊(n − 1)/m⌋ + 1** objects.  
- Example: In a group of **10 people**, if only **9 distinct first letters** exist in their names, at least two individuals share the same initial letter.  
- **Generalized Formulation:** This version addresses multiple constraints, such as identifying patterns in large datasets or optimizing resource allocation.

**Slide 5: Significance and Conclusion**  
**Text:**  
- The Pigeonhole Principle is a **simple yet profound** tool with far-reaching implications in logic, probability, and optimization.  
- It is indispensable in problem-solving, particularly in competitive programming and theoretical proofs.  
- **Key Insight:** Repetition is inevitable when resources are limited—understanding this principle aids in identifying patterns and optimizing resource distribution.
